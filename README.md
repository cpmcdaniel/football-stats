# football-stats

football-stats provides an API for accessing and storing NFL Regular
season statistics. The current target is a Datomic backend. With this
you will be able to perform all sorts of statistical analysis on NFL
game data.

## TODO

* Finish installation of basic team info.
* For storing game stats, create a function that finds or creates all
  the players from the game and returns a map of nflids -> entity ids
  for use in subsequent transactions.
* Apply same procedure to store visitor team stats.
* Optionally store the scoring summary.
* Optionally store the drive summaries.


## Usage
