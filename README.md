# football-stats

football-stats provides an API for accessing and storing NFL Regular
season statistics. The current target is a Datomic backend. With this
you will be able to perform all sorts of statistical analysis on NFL
game data.

## TODO

* Clean up storage.clj
  * Try to find declarative way to map NFL JSON to Datomic schema.
  * Remove duplication
* Resolve position for each player.
* Datomic channel not created if datomic connection can not be
  established. 
* files->datomic should not create dupes.

## Usage

This project is not yet in a usable state and a lot of this is a work
in progress. Check back in the future for usage instructions.
